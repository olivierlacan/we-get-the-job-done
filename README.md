> Talent is distributed, opportunity isn't.

This list could be used as a weapon against companies listed herein but
I can't fix xenophobia. It's already hard enough for a foreign U.S.
university graduate (like me) on an [F-1][1] "non-immigrant" visa to
find any company willing to hire them.

Getting hired out of school isn't the hardest part. An F-1 [OPT][2]
period expires after 2.5 years. That's a heartbeat in someone's career.
Educated, trained, and experienced workers who are legally required to
seek work in their own field of study and to be paid a market wage are
routinely forced (like I was) to upend their life and return to their
home country. At home, they often don't have the student and
professional networks they worked so hard to establish in the U.S.

If your company (or a company you know of) is publicly willing to hire
the best people the world has to offer, please submit a [Pull Request][pr]
adding it to the list below. The [H-1B][3] column signifies the company is
willing to *sponsor* H-1B candidates which can be a lengthy process.
Since H-1B visas are capped at two 3-year terms, it can be crucial for
someone willing to plant roots in the U.S. to know they have a path to
permanent residency with [EB-1][4] or [EB-2][5] applications.

Although permanent residency *should* remove constant threat under which
so-called "non-immigrant" workers live, they're still taxed without
representation until they become elligible for citizenship after **5 years**.
